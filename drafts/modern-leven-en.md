I am standing in a room in front of a large glass wall. The wall is glowing, light and warm, pulsating softly. A gentle pressure that pushes me back and forth. I lean forward. Rhythmic swaying. Slowly drifting off.

It's as if I'm floating through a thin space. Or rather, I'm standing still and it's the space that's floating. Entire worlds are drifting by. Like lying in the grass with your eyes closed while huge clouds pass by in the sky. A feeling of falling while standing still. It's the world that's falling. Not you.

A voice. A man's voice, deep, friendly, asks if I'm ready. I say, "I've learned everything you asked me to. Except for that part with all the facts."

"Did I ask for that?"

"Something like that."

"I must have forgotten."

"We should talk about that one of these days, your forgetfulness."

"I always do my best for you, you know that."

"Let's start now."

The pulsing decreases. A spacious meadow landscape appears, but it quickly changes into a more urban environment and after some difficult-to-follow changes, I am sitting behind a desk in brightly colored artificial light. There is an audience applauding. A man in a suit, the quiz master, quickly chats before taking a seat opposite me. He welcomes me. I nod that we can start.

"The first throw is a seven. The second a fourteen. There are no more throws," he explains.

I let a silence fall. Then, with solemn voice, I bring up the inevitable. The audience is shocked. The quiz master can't believe it. Attempts are made to dissuade me from my plan. Promises of improvement, temporary discounts, and so on. Not all attempts are equally classy. I stick to my guns.

Once back in the room, the voice is naturally informed. Yet I feel the need to explain.

"I canceled my subscription. If you want, I can explain why."

"As you wish. Explanation is not necessary now. There will be another questionnaire."

"I hope you're not disappointed."

"Feelings are not part of my program. Don't worry. As I said, there will be another questionnaire. Have a nice day."

The glass of the wall becomes transparent. Immediately, I fall forward.
