# Learning C in 2023

I don't really have a bucket list, but if I were to have one, learning C would probably be on there. The idea keeps popping up in my head every now and then. It has been doing that for years.

Another thing that keeps popping up every now and then is an advise I read somewhere on the internet some time ago, and that is that a good way to keep things interesting as a developer is to try to learn a new programming language every year.

Indeed, this project is an attempt to combine the two. This year I will try to focus on the C programming language and learn as much about it as I can.
With such a rich and famous history, I will try to attempt to write an introduction or overview. I don't think there is anyone in the tech world that does not know about its existence. C is ubiquitous. It's significance and its history are covered by many websites, books and videos.<!-- more -->

For an outsider, this food of information might be too much. A concise overview could be very helpful. Ilja van Sprundel gave a presentation that is just that:
