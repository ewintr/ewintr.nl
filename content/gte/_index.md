The modern world always offers lots of solutions for any given problem. Including something a simple as maintaining a list of tasks. Often though, all these services and solutions look very much alike, with the same features and the same drawbacks. If that one-size-fits-all approach doesn't suit you, you have to take more drastic measures and build it yourself.

So here it is, Getting Things Email, my very own task management system that:

* Is not tied to any particular service provider.
* Can be used by any device, with or without a dedicated app.
* Synchronizes between devices, but can handle longer periods of not being connected to the internet.

A more detailed motivation to start this project is here. Code can be found [here](https://codeberg.org/ewintr/gte).
