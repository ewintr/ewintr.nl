Ever since it inception, I have harbored a strong dislike for the word "blog". To me it just sounds wrong.  As if someone is vomiting. But when you think of it, it is kind of appropriate. Blogs often are no more than just a collection of random thoughts that just need to be expressed and disposed of. Write then down to clear your headand the rest becomes irrelevant. Someone can read it. No-one can read it. All is fine.

Here is my bucket with stuff. I am approaching this in the style of [#100daystooffload](https://100daystooffload.com/), we'll see what comes out. But I will keep using the older, unabbreviated form of the word: weblog.
