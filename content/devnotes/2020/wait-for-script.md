Docker-compose has the option of making a container depend on another container, so it will not start the former before the latter is running. This is useful for containers with applications that need other infrastructure, for instance a database, present. The common problem with this is that although the database container is ready, that does not mean that the database application inside is also ready to accept connections.<!-- more --> To fix this, there are several scripts available on Github. A simple one that works is this one: [wait-for](https://github.com/eficode/wait-for)

Only `sh` is needed, but `netcat` needs to be present in the calling container. See `README.md` for details.

The only file from the repository you really need is the one copied below;

```
#!/bin/sh

TIMEOUT=15
QUIET=0

echoerr() {
  if [ "$QUIET" -ne 1 ]; then printf "%s\n" "$*" 1>&2; fi
}

usage() {
  exitcode="$1"
  cat << USAGE >&2
Usage:
  $cmdname host:port [-t timeout] [-- command args]
  -q | --quiet                        Do not output any status messages
  -t TIMEOUT | --timeout=timeout      Timeout in seconds, zero for no timeout
  -- COMMAND ARGS                     Execute command with args after the test finishes
USAGE
  exit "$exitcode"
}

wait_for() {
  for i in `seq $TIMEOUT` ; do
    nc -z "$HOST" "$PORT" > /dev/null 2>&1
    
    result=$?
    if [ $result -eq 0 ] ; then
      if [ $# -gt 0 ] ; then
        exec "$@"
      fi
      exit 0
    fi
    sleep 1
  done
  echo "Operation timed out" >&2
  exit 1
}

while [ $# -gt 0 ]
do
  case "$1" in
    *:* )
    HOST=$(printf "%s\n" "$1"| cut -d : -f 1)
    PORT=$(printf "%s\n" "$1"| cut -d : -f 2)
    shift 1
    ;;
    -q | --quiet)
    QUIET=1
    shift 1
    ;;
    -t)
    TIMEOUT="$2"
    if [ "$TIMEOUT" = "" ]; then break; fi
    shift 2
    ;;
    --timeout=*)
    TIMEOUT="${1#*=}"
    shift 1
    ;;
    --)
    shift
    break
    ;;
    --help)
    usage 0
    ;;
    *)
    echoerr "Unknown argument: $1"
    usage 1
    ;;
  esac
done

if [ "$HOST" = "" -o "$PORT" = "" ]; then
  echoerr "Error: you need to provide a host and port to test."
  usage 2
fi

wait_for "$@"
```
