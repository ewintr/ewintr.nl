Some notes, articles and tutorials on software development. It's a mishmash of topics. The thing they have in common is that at some point I was figuring out a problem on a computer or a phone and I wished that the internet would provide me with this info in a blog post.

Maybe a search engine picks them up and someone else can save a bit of time.
