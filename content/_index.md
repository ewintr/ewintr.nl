## Hi, 

My name is Erik, and I am a Dutch software developer. Go is my language of choice, as one can easily gather from the projects listed on this site. At work I like to program in Go, outside of work I like to program in Go. 

When I am not programming... I dream of programming in Go. Nah, just kidding, I do the same things as everyone else. Listen to music, watch movies and spend time with loved ones.

## Projects

Check out [Now Playing](/now-playing) to see what is currently keeping me busy. Or see [Paused](/paused) for older projects that I put on hold.
