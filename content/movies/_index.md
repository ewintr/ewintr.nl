With the ever expanding options to watch movies, both online and offline, I lost sight of what I watched and what my impressions were. So here I try to keep track of them.

My personal rating system:

&#9733; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;  - So bad I couldn't finish it.

&#9733; &#9733; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;  - Somewhat interesting, but there were parts where I got bored.

&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9734; &#9734;  - Kept me entertained from beginning to end.

&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9734;  - Resonates so well, images kept popping up in my head afterwards.

&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;  - Changed my perspective on life.
