## Code

All my public repositories can be found on [codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/ewintr) or, if you insist, on [github.com](https://github.com/ewintr).


## Hire me!

If you need some help with a Go backend, I am open to contract opportunities. See my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-winter-5767a923b/) for experience and ways to contact me professionaly.

## Contact

For other forms of communication, over the years I have had accounts on Mastodon, Matrix, IRC and others, but each time I ended up abandoning them. I guess I am not the type for endless streams of realtime communication. The only thing that stayed was [email](mailto:info@ewintr.nl). So maybe try that.
