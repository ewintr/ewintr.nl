# Sounds

If you would go on the internet and search for a top ten list of things not to do when trying to learn how to play the guitar, then... you would have a pretty accurate description of my attempts to learn how to play the guitar:

* Using way to much distortion ✓<br>
  _...so I could not hear what I was actually doing._
* Practicing with the song playing ✓<br>
  _....so I overreached by going too fast too soon._
* Repeating the same bits over and over again ✓<br>
  _....so I never improved or learned something new._
*
* Yeah, I did them all.

As a result, I put in a lot of time and it never really went anywhere. Still, there where bright moments where I was enjoying myself. On a few occasions I even recorded it.
