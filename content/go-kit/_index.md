This is a collection of some small go packages that were useful enough for me to include them in more than one project. It contains:

* `log` - An adapter for third party logging libraries.
* `slugify` - Generate url's from titles.
* `smtp` - Simple wrapper around the smtp package in the standard library.
* `test` - Minimalist set of functions for unit testing.

Code can be found [here](https://codeberg.org/ewintr/go-kit).
